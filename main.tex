\chapter{Introduction}
\textit{This dissertation explores efficient search strategies for parsing a symbolic music data using a musical grammar. We present ... which extends a recent model, addressing problems of intractability by using Heuristic search methods. We will see that that my novel heuristic search algorithm achieves .... }

\section{Motivation}

A piece of music can be described using a sequence of chords, representing a higher level harmonic structure of a piece. There is a small, finite set of chord types, but each chord can be realised on the musical surface in a practically infinite number of ways. Given a score, we wish to infer the underlying chord types. This is often a time consuming and cognitively demanding expert task \cite{masadaChordRecognitionSymbolic2018}, hence its utility.

\par
The paper \textit{Modeling and Inferring Proto-voice Structure in Free Polyphony} describes a generative model that encodes the recursive and hierarchical dependencies between notes, giving rise to a grammar-like hierarchical system \cite{finkensiepMODELINGINFERRINGPROTOVOICE2021}. This proto-voice model can be used to reduce a piece into a hierarchical structure which encodes an understanding of the tonal/harmonic relations.
\par
Christoph Finkensiep suggests in his thesis that the proto-voice model may be an effective way to infer higher level latent entities, such as harmonies or voice leading schemata. Thus in this project I will ask the question: is this parsing model an effective way to annotate harmonies? By ‘effective’ we are referring to two things:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Accuracy: can the model successfully emulate how experts annotate harmonic progressions in musical passages? 
  \item Practicality: can the model be used to do this within a reasonable time frame?
\end{itemize}

While the original model could in theory be used to generate harmonic annotations, its exhaustive search strategy would be prohibitively time-consuming in practice for any but the shortest musical extracts; one half measure can have over 100,000 valid derivations \cite{finkensiepStructureFreePolyphony2023}. My approach will be to explore the use of heuristic search algorithms to solve this problem.

\section{Related Work}
First grammar/rule-based systems \cite{maxwellExpertSystemHarmonizing1992} \cite{winogradLinguisticsComputerAnalysis1968}, optimisation algorithms \cite{pardoAlgorithmsChordalAnalysis2002} and supervised learning approaches making use of large datasets \cite{niEndtoendMachineLearning2011} \cite{mcleodModularSystemHarmonic2021} \cite{masadaChordRecognitionSymbolic2018}.
\par
Distinction to be drawn between approaches that take segmented or non-segmented pieces. Some models make use of a joint segmentation and labelling approach \cite{masadaChordRecognitionSymbolic2018}...

\chapter{Preparation}
\textit{In this chapter, I present the work which was undertaken before the code was written. After a brief description of my starting point, I provide an exposition of the Proto-voice Model which forms the foundation of this project. Subsequently, I discuss probabilistic programming and Bayesian inference, including a probabilistic model of harmony. Finally, I describe the software engineering techniques and principles used throughout the project. }

\section{Background Material}

\subsection{Proto-voice Model}
TODO: Brief description of what notes are, what is a piece of music, introduce relevant musical terminology (Score, note, protovoice, repetition, neighbor/ ornament(choose one?)). Conflict of meaning with root-note (generative operation) and root note (musical terminology). What are the main assumptions/ information we need to know in order to understand the proto-voice model?

\par
TODO: Motivation of the model as a generative model on the note level, describing the piece as a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). What is a proto-voice exactly? 
\par 

The proto-voice model is characterised by 3 primitive generative operations on notes.

\begin{itemize}
  % \setlength\itemsep{1em}
 \item Repetitions 
  \item Neighbor notes 
  \item Passing notes
\end{itemize}

Operations with two notes are represented by edge replacement. 
\[p_1 \to p_2 ~~~\implies~~ p_1 \to c \to p_2 \label{edge replacement}\]

\subsubsection{Proto-voice Operations}

To model simulataneity of notes we introduce slices, which are multisets of pitches, representing segments of a piece where a group of notes are heard. 
\par 
Diagram showing a slice + a diagram showing a higher level slices, grouping an arpegiation.
\par 
A slice $m$ is defined as a multiset of pitches.
\par 
A transition $t = (s_l, e, s_r)$  relates two slices with a configuration of edges $e=(e_{reg}, e_{pass})$, a set of regular edges (repetition or neighbor), and a set of passing edges.
\par
Outer operations (Diagram of all three operations): 
\par
Split: \[t \to t'_l s' t'_r\]
Spread: \[t_l~s~t_r \to t'_l~s'_l~t'_m~s'_r~t'_r\]
Freeze: \[t \to t \]

\subsubsection{Proto-voice harmony}
How do we get from a proto-voice (partial)derivation to a harmonic inference?
\par
Explain what harmony is, and how the proto-voice model allows us to capture harmony. Elaboration of the introduction.
\par
What assumptions are needed for a protovoice derivation to be able to describe harmonic entities? These shape heuristic design.
\par


\subsection{Probabilistic Programming}
Provide an explanation of all the concepts I learned and used in this project. 
Techniques such as marginalisation, joint distributions, bayes rule etc. 
Probabilistic programming is the combination model definitions and statistical inference algorithms for computing the conditional distribution of inputs (chords) that could have given rise to the observed output (score). We are making the assumption that the score is a realisation of the latent harmonic entities. 

Dirchelet distributions
Beta distribution  
Multinomiall distribution 
Normal Distribution 

\par 
Inference as model $\to$ data $\to$ prob distribution $\to$ chord guess

\subsection{Probabilistic Model of Harmony}

Outline of the probabilistic model of harmony, describing the parts that are relevant for harmonic annotations. This section allows the reader to understand the evaluation and heuristic modules.

\par
Describe how the parameters were attained
\par
Then describe how to go from the parameters to chord, chordtone and ornamentation distributions
\par

Parameters:
\par
pHarmonies: $\mathbb{N}^{n_c}$\\
pChordtones: $\mathbb{N}^{n_c}$\\
pOrnaments: $\mathbb{N}^{n_c}$
\par
Chordtypes, $C = \{\text{M,~m, Mm7, om, o7, mm7, \%7, MM7, +, Ger, It, Fr, mM7, +7}\}$

\[\vec{\chi}' \sim \text{Dirchlet} (\text{pHarmonies}, n_c) \]

\[\vec{\chi} = \mathbb{E} (\vec{X}_i) = \frac{\alpha_i}{\sum\limits_j \alpha_j} \]

Chord: \[c \sim \text{Categorical}(\vec{\chi})\]

Single chordtone distribution. We want to find $P(p|c, ct)$ probability of the pitch given the chord, and that the note is a chordtone:
\[\vec{\phi}_{ct}' \sim \text{Dirchlet}(pChordtones, n_p) \implies \vec{\phi}\]

For each of these parameters we use the MLE to get our probability distribution. 
\[\vec{\phi}_{ct} = \text{MLE} (\vec{\phi}_{ct}')\]
\[\vec{\phi}_{or} = \text{MLE} (\vec{\phi}_{or}')\]
\[\vec{\chi}= \text{MLE} (\vec{\chi}') \]
Then for each chord tone,
\[p_{ct} \sim \text{Categorical}(\vec{\phi}_{ct})\]
\[p_{or} \sim \text{Categorical}(\vec{\phi}_{or})\]
We get the distribution of likelihoods for each pitch.






\subsection{Heuristic Search Algorithms}

The following describes an overview of the project repository:

\section{Core Implementation}

\subsection{Heuristic Parser}
This is not a descriptive name. Think of a new name to describe the implementation of the search space of partial reductions.

\subsection{Evaluation Module}
We need to know exactly what we are trying to achieve before we can understand the baseline and extention implementations.

\subsubsection{Probabilistic Model of Harmony}
When evaluating using the protovoice model: we assume that we result in only chord tones for each segment. Thus we can use the chord tone probabilities to evaluate the prediction. 
\par
When just using a random sample, we have to assume that there is a mixture model of chord tones and ornaments. We can use the learnt parameters to determine the distribution.
\par
These two measures of likelihoods are comparable as they are drawn from the same distributions.
\par
We also need to infer chord labels. We can simply choose the chord that is most likely according to our model.
\par 
This gives us two key metrics, likelihood and accuracy.
\par
Could also use a more sophisticated notion of accuracy, using a chord similarity function \cite{humphreyFourTimelyInsights2015}. The {\texttt {mir\_eval}} package provides a plethora of metrics to compare chord label predictions \cite{raffelMirEvalTransparent2014}. 

\section{Baseline implementation}

\subsection{Random Sample Parser}
As a crude baseline we develop two algorithms based on randomly sampling notes for each segment to infer the chord label. 
\par
The pure random sample algorithm simply samples random notes for each segment, and uses those to guess the chord label. This doesn't even consider the notes of the piece, so it's really bad, but provides a useful reference.
\par 
The per segment sample algorithm samples notes from each segment. Could just sample a random number of notes from each segment, or just use all the notes in the segment to predict the most likely chord label. This is reminiscent of using a key-profile model \cite{temperleyBayesianApproachKeyFinding2002} to find local keys.

\subsection{Random Choice Search}
Now we use our implementation of the protovoice parser, but just do a random walk in the tree of partial reductions. By comparing this against the random ample parser, we can get an idea of the utility of the model. We show that this works surprisingly well.

\section{Extension Implementation}

\subsection{Heuristic Design}
Step 1: Design heuristic to be as accurate as possible. I.e the extreme is to consider every possible parse, but for a single piece there can be over $10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10}}}}}$ different parses. We consider 1 step at a time at first - this still results in needing to choose an operation out of upwards of 30,000,000 options for just a single step.     
\par
First the full piece heuristic parse 
\par
Problem of very large slices.\\ 
Segment by segment heuristic parse - avoids the problem, but is slightly hacky. Can we incorprate our knowledge regarding the relative proportion of chord tones and ornaments. Should we allow duplicates of notes in slices? Perhaps we should favour spreads more. 
\par
Always consider a certain number of slices and spreads.
\par

\subsection{Heuristic Search}
Step 2: Relax the heuristic search in order to reduce runtime/ lower complexity.
\par 
In the case that there are 85,000,000 options, perhaps we should sample the options rather than evaluating all of them. 
\par 
This version of heuristic search should be able to parse full pieces (hopefully), so can be used to compare with the baselines on an entire corpus.

\section{Testing}
Show unit tests, and examples of the test/development cycle for the heuristic search development

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Evaluation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\chapter{Evaluation}
\textit{In this chapter, I provide qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the work completed. I then provide and interpret evidence to show that the success criteria were met.}

\textit{The main questions to answer are as follows:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Can the proto-voice model be used to accurately infer chord labels?}
  \item \textit{Can the proto-voice model be used to practically infer chord labels?}
  \item \textit{How well my heuristic search algorithms infer chord labels?}
\end{itemize}

\section{Accuracy}
Things to note
\begin{itemize}
  \item The fact that segmentation is known ahead of time provides a great deal of information \cite{gothamWhatIfWhen2021}
  \item So we can use comparisons between the random sample from each segment algorithm and the random parse algorithm to see if the use of the grammar provides an advantage over just sampling the notes directly, without looking at relations between notes.
  \item Then we want a heuristic search algorithm that considers each option exhaustively and finds the best local option. This is too computationally expensive to be used for whole pieces. 
  \item Given there can be millions of possible next states in the search, we need to look at different strategies to avoid searching through them all. E.g just sample states. 
  \item Sensitivity Analysis for the heuristic search is useful for the evaluation. Explore how robust it is to handcrafted attacks/ different types of passages.
  \item Could evaluate by segments instead of pieces. 
\end{itemize}
