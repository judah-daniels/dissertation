\chapter{Preparation}
\textit{In this chapter, I present the work which was undertaken before the code was written. After a brief description of my starting point, I provide an exposition of the Proto-voice Model which forms the foundation of this project. Subsequently, I discuss probabilistic programming and Bayesian inference, including a probabilistic model of harmony. Finally, I describe the software engineering techniques and principles used throughout the project. }

\chapter{Evaluation}
\textit{In this chapter, I provide qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the work completed. I then provide and interpret evidence to show that the success criteria were met.}

\textit{The main questions to answer are as follows:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Can the proto-voice model be used to accurately infer chord labels?}
  \item \textit{Can the proto-voice model be used to practically infer chord labels?}
  \item \textit{How well my heuristic search algorithms infer chord labels?}
\end{itemize}
